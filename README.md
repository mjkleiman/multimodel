MultiModel
===========

Previous studies have shown that targeting different classes using unique sets of hyperparameters and features can improve overall classification accuracy, instead of applying the same hyperparameters and/or models to each class.

This simple Python script enables multiple models, each with their own tuned hyperparameters and features, to be used to target each individual class.
